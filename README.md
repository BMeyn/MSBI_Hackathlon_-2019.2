# MSBI_Hackathon_2019.2

Welcome to second MSBI hackathlon 2019!

This time we want to take a closer look at the Azure Maschine AI Services. We will try to build a end to end AI solution. Therfore we will use different Azure Ressources and hopefully you will learn something new on the way.

The AI solution we want to build is a architecture that can read numbers from water and electic meters. The aim is to get the full solution running. That means we will use Azure Maschine Learning Services to create the Machine Learning Model and a Azure Function App to trigger the Model if we write a new image into a blob or DataLake storage.
